# ROSBehave
Automated Test Framework for Robot Operating System
This is my Dissertation project for my Bsc(Hons) Computer Science

This project uses Catkin to package the open-source ROS Nodes with a bespoke set of unit tests which are actually fully automated end-to-end tests driven by the Gherkin Syntax.
Using Behaviour Driven Development, this framework turns simple english language phrases into a library of automated actions capable of controlling a robot.
